              <h3>Systems engineering</h3>
              <p>At ConSysTec, nearly everything we do involves the use of the Systems Engineering process.</p>

              <p>All ITS projects involve risk.  However, the Systems Engineering process provides a structured methodology for managing complex ITS systems. Our staff is highly qualified in the practice of Systems Engineering and have written guidance documents on applying systems engineering in ITS, developed systems engineering content for ITS standards, and performed systems engineering analysis for regional multi-modal systems.</p>

              <p>By helping navigate the Systems Engineering process, ConSysTec helps our clients reduce the risk involved in the project while adhering to FHWA and FTA policies.<br>
              ConSysTec offers specific services related to Systems Engineering.  These services include but are not limited to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>●	Systems Engineering Analysis for specific ITS Projects</b><br>
                  Systems Engineering is a process that breaks a project down and puts it back 	together.  This is done to ensure that the correct system is being built and the 	system is being built properly.
                  <br><br>                   With ConSysTec’s extensive experience in all phases of the Systems Engineering 	process, including the development of documentation (i.e., Concept of 	Operations, System Requirements, System Design Specifications, Test Plans, 	etc.) our clients can feel confident that the work is done right and in 	conformance with federal guidelines.
                </li>
                <li><b>●	Prepare procurement documents</b><br>
                  Preparing concise, accurate and timely procurement documents is crucial to 	the success of any ITS project.  At ConSysTec, we have extensive experience in 	helping our clients prepare procurement documents which utilize the Systems 	Engineering process to define the requirements for a system as specified in a 	procurement specification.</li>
                <li><b>●	Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) / Testing</b><br>
                    Our staff can independently develop test plans, specifications, and procedures 	to verify that the system is built properly and can validate that the proper 	system was built. At ConSysTec, we feel that it is a best practice to have testing 	performed by an independent reviewer.</li>
              </ul>

            <h3>Why ITS architectures?</h3>
            <p>As an industry leader in the development of regional and statewide ITS architectures, ConSysTec is proud to have played a key role in developing ITS architectures for 84 regions, states and countries.</p>

              <p>All regions of the United States with ITS projects using Federal funds MUST have a regional ITS Architecture.  Within the United States, ConSysTec develops regional ITS architectures that conform to the U.S. National ITS Architecture.  Our specialty is rapidly and accurately developing stakeholder consensus-based multi-modal ITS architectures that are usable.</p>

              <p>But why is an ITS Architecture needed? ITS Architectures provide a common basis for planners and engineers with differing concerns to conceive, design and implement systems using a common language as a basis for delivering an ITS project.  Each regional ITS architecture accounts for that region's local needs, stakeholders, subsystems, ITS deployments, and institutional barriers.</p>

              <p>Over the years, we have pioneered methods of developing and representing ITS architectures that have delighted our many customers. As part of our standard ITS architecture services, our work is based on RAD-IT (Regional Architecture Development for Intelligent Transportation). Our webpages provide links between the ITS architecture and transportation plans; and shows how programmed ITS projects are represented in the ITS architecture.</p>

              <p>When an ITS Architecture is completed, our goal is for each stakeholder to agree that as they build out their ITS elements and projects, they will allow for interoperability, as well as, share information as shown in the customized regional ITS architecture. This is the “consensus” that ConSysTec strives to achieve in each regional ITS architecture we develop.</p>

            <h3>ITS Standards</h3>
            <p>ITS standards are based on open, non-proprietary interfaces that can be used to facilitate the deployment of interoperable ITS systems.  In addition, ITS Standards make it easier for state and local ITS deployers to develop and deploy integrated transportation systems.  Deploying open standards reduces risk and costs in ITS projects, by supporting competition for ITS systems while providing a path for future expansion and upgrades.</p>
            <p>ConSysTec plays an active role in ITS Standards and is a recognized industry leader. We have led the development, or, played an integral role in the development of most of the key ITS Standards in the past decade, including for Connected Vehicles.</p>
            <p>We actively participate in many of the working groups of Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) related to ITS standards, including the NTCIP Joint Committee, NTCIP working groups, ISO TC 204, and the SAE V2X Technical Committees.</p>
            <p>As experts and developers of ITS Standards, ConSysTec provides technical support in the deployment of ITS Standards, including standards-based procurement specifications, creating test plans and providing training and workshop support).</p>
            <p>Services we offer include but are not limited to:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>●	Developing standards-based specifications and ITS standards deployment plans</li>
              <li>●	Offering technical and non-technical training on ITS standards</li>

            <h3>ITS Training</h3>
            <p>Based on our expertise and experience in providing ITS training, ConSysTec is able to work with our clients to successfully develop and provide customized training classes in all of our core business areas. Our customized training classes have included presentations, course materials and interactive exercises. Training can be performed both in person or via webinar.</p>

            <p>Understanding ITS Architecture, ITS Standards, and Systems Engineering can be a daunting task.  That’s why ConSysTec has developed a comprehensive training program that focuses on helping clients and government better these complex methodologies.</p>

            <p>We have developed numerous training courses from online training courses to one-time customized, in-person training courses for private companies.  We also provide training for individuals, small groups, or large groups.  Areas we offer training in include, but are not limited to:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>●	Using ITS Architectures</li>
              <li>●	Applying the Systems Engineering Process</li>
              <li>●	Using ITS Communication Standards Project Management</li>

            <h3>Transit Data</h3>
            <p>Our transit practice is built around sharing transit related data and information. ITS standards are not restricted to highways.  Transit data can have many forms.  This data can be for service schedules, planning data, real time information, fare data, and more.</p> 
            <p>ConSysTec encourages Transit (bus and rail) operators to conform to data standards to achieve institutional and technical integration.</p> 
            <p>In order for transit agencies to share data, it should be developed and deployed in one of two open formats.  They are the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS), and/or the Service Interface for Real-Time Information (SIRI).</p> 
            <p>Our work in this area involves developing systems and actively managing data sets to facilitate the sharing of transit related data among transit agencies, and between transit agencies and consumers.</p> 
            <p>Our transit data services include:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>●	Develop data models and feed specifications to be used in real time transit systems</li>
              <li>●	High level system design for real time transit information systems, including the development of Concept of Operations and System Requirements documentation.</li>
              <li>●	Collect and process transit data from transit agencies for use in regional trip 	planning applications. Support a transit agency’s ability to translate schedule 	and other data into industry standard feed formats, including the General 	Transit Feed Specification (GTFS), and the Schedule Data Profile (SDP) 	Standard, developed by ConSysTec for the New York State Department of 	Transportation (NYSDOT).</li>
              <li>●	Perform outreach to agencies to facilitate this process.</li>
