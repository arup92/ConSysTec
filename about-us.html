          <h3>Our Company</h3>
          <p>ConSysTec is a leader in applying systems engineering to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), with specialties in ITS Standards and ITS Architectures.</p>

          <p>We develop Concept of Operations, Requirements documents, and Verification and Validation Plans for ITS projects.</p>

          <p>Because of our leadership and participation in the develop of the US DOT's National ITS Architecture and US ITS Standards, we have extensive expertise and experience that gives us a comprehensive understanding of both the technical and institutional issues associated with the development and deployment of regional ITS planning, as well as, deploying ITS technology solutions.</p>

          <p>Since 2001, we have been driven by the desire to meet and exceed our customer's goals and objectives. We do this by engaging all possible stakeholders to gain a full understanding of their needs and desires on each specific project, so our priorities align exactly with those of the customer.</p>

          <h3>Our History</h3>
          <p>ConSysTec was founded in 2001 by Dr. Robert Jaffe and Bruce Eisenhart. At that time, the USDOT has just enacted the Final Rule and FTA Policy on ITS Architectures and Standards. This rule required the development of regional ITS architectures within four years for regions using federal funding for ITS projects. Due to their experience in developing the National ITS Architecture, ConSysTec was able to provide leadership throughout the nation in creating many regionsâ€™ first ITS architectures. Our ITS architecture practice area has grown internationally, where we have developed ITS architectures spanning four continents</p>

          <p>As our team grew, our practice grew into many areas with applying the systems engineering to ITS - we develop concept of operations and requirements documents for complex systems; develop, specify and test ITS standards. We provide services for the full lifecycle of an ITS system - except build, operate and maintain.</p>
